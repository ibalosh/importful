This is a small Ruby on Rails application designed to manage affiliate data for merchants. The app allows merchants to:

- **Sign Up** and **Sign In** to their accounts.
- **Upload CSV Files** containing affiliate data.
- **Transform and Store** the uploaded data into the database.

The app processes the uploaded CSV files, validates the data, and stores it in a structured format for further use.

The initial task for this app can be found [here](TASK.md).

### Example CSV File

You can find an example CSV file [here](examples/affiliates-small.csv).
